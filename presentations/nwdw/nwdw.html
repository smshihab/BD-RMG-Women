# Introduction

---
# Against the grain: Bangladeshi FLFP

&lt;img src="nwdw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Labor force participation among 20-24 year olds stood at about 49% in 2015 (ADB 2016).

---
# Expansion of the garments industry

&lt;img src="nwdw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- More than 75% of Bangladesh's exports since 1997s.

- .hi[About 60% of workers] in export oriented RMG industry are women.

  - The share seems to be declining.

---

#Inter-related changes?

## Declining fertility

&lt;img src="nwdw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

#Inter-related changes?

## Women at school

Lower secondary (about middle school) completion rates in total female population  completion rate of __4.4% in 1981__ to .hi[41% in 2019.] (World Bank, 2020)

Literacy among .hi[15-24 age group exceeds 96 percentage in 2019.] (World Bank, 2020)


---

# Research question

   1. I start by examining whether the garments industry .hi[increased] and changed the .hi[pattern] of female labor force participation in Bangladesh.
 
--

   2. Labor force participation decisions maybe interrelated to .hi[marriage formation] and .hi[reproductive behavior], .hi[human capital investment on girls], and .hi[autonomy] of women.

--

    - I also examine whether the garments industry in Bangladesh changed the aforementioned dimensions of women's lives.

---

# Prior research

## Heath and Mobarak (2015, JDE)

- Survey of 1395 households in 60 villages in four sub-districts of Bangladesh.

  - 44 in garments commuting zones and 16 away, surveyed in 2009.

  - Average distance from capital is 1.8 KM for garment commuting zones, 6.8 KM for non-garments commuting zones.
  
--

- They found that girls exposed to the garment sector

  - Increases FLFP by 15 pp
  - Decreases fertility by 29 pp
  - Reduces gender education gap by 1.5 years.
  
---

# Prior research

## Li (2018, JIE)

- Uses Bartik-type instruments exploiting the variation in skill intensity of industries and spatial variation in industry specialization.

  - Found that high skill export shock increased educational attainment China between 1990 to 2005.


## Autor et. al (2019, AER:I)

- Uses bartik-type instruments to find that:

  - Trade shocks reduced employment by 2.6 pp for both sexes.
  - Negative shocks to male-dominated industries reduce family formation and fertility, whereas negative shocks to female-dominated industries tend to increase family formation and fertility.
  
---

# My expected contributions

- Provide alternative estimates of the labor demand shock on FLFP and pattern of FLFP that rely on exploiting variation in knit versus woven specialization of a RMG producing region, and variation in aggregate knit and woven exports over time. 

  - Controls for spatial development patterns better.
  
- Greater geographic and temporal coverage of data.

- Explore additional topics related to lives of women in Bangladesh.

# Data and Empirical Approach 

---
# Factory data

Factory data are primarily from **Mapped in Bangladesh Project.**

  - Between 2017 and 2021, the project gathered information on all potentially existing factories from government and trade groups.
  
  - Processed the list and physically verified locations of 3805 factories.
  
  - But they did not have data on factories from export processing zone, which I obtained by scraping Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association **(BGMEA) website.**

---
# Spatial Evolution of Factories

&lt;img src="nwdw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Factory catchment area

- For each factory, we define a catchment area of 1.686 KM based on estimates of travel time of RMG workers and walking speed estimates.

--

- Agglomeration leads to overlap of catchment area, and exposure in intersecting areas are summed.

&lt;img src="figures//catchment_area.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Outcome data

- Outcome data is obtained from geo-coded **Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys** 2000-2018

--

  - Nationally representative HH survey data in 2962 clusters.
  
--

  - .hi[Pros:] Allows us to ask questions about changes in reproductive behavior beyond fertility.
  
--

  - .hi[Cons:] But geo-codes are randomly displaced to protect anonymity.
  
--

  - Only locations within factory catchment areas is selected to avoid comparing areas with and without any factory.

# Selected Samples

&lt;img src="nwdw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Overview of the identification strategy

I estimate regressions of the following form:

`\begin{align*}
Y_{i,c,t}&amp;= \beta_z Z + \beta X_{c,t} + \delta_t + \text{Birth Year}_{i,c,t} + \epsilon_{i,c,t}
\end{align*}`

`\begin{align*}
Y_{i,c,t}&amp;: \text{Outcome of person } i \text{ in catchment area } c \text{ at time } t.\\
X_{c,t}&amp;: \text{Measure of export exposure in} \text{ catchment area } c \text{ at time } t\\
Z&amp;: \text{is a vector of individual and location specific controls}\\
\end{align*}`

---
# Overview of the identification strategy

**Key challenge:** Location of exporting firms are likely correlated with other variables that likely influence the outcome variables.

--

 - I restrict my analysis to a narrowly defined catchment area based on factory locations.
 
--

- Garment factories specialize in production of .hi[knit or woven type of garments. But many produce both.] 

  - I make use of spatial variation in knit and woven specialization, and temporal variation in export of knit and woven products to estimate plausibly exogenous measures of export exposure.
 
---
# Export exposure


I use a Bartik-type export exposure measure:

`\begin{align*}
X_{c,t} &amp;= Export \space Shock_{c,t} \\
\textit{where } Export \space Shock_{c,t} &amp;= \frac{\alpha_{c,t}^{knit} * \Delta Knit \space Export_{t-T}}{Population_{c,t}} \\
&amp;+ \frac{(1 - \alpha_{c,t}^{knit}) * \Delta Woven \space Export_{t-T}}{Population_{c,t}} \\ \\
\textit{and } \alpha_{c,t}^{knit} &amp;= \frac{Workers_{c,knit,t}}{Workers_{BD,t}}
\end{align*}`


- T = 3 in baseline specification, and

- Shares are instrumented with 3-year lags.

---
# Threats to identification

- Assumes orthogonality of knit and woven share to outcomes
    
  - Defensible since infrastructure, not labor related issues, seem to be the key factor in location choice of garments factories.
  
- Coordinates of sample clusters are randomly displaced.
  

- Firm exits are not accounted for.

  - For example, my dataset identifies about 1914 of 3548 firms in 2009.
  
  - One concern is if exists are geographically correlated.
  
  - Second concern is loss of variation.

# Conemporenaous influence on FLFP




&lt;img src="figures//contemp_flfp.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

# Medium term influence on FLFP

&lt;img src="figures//three_flfp.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Migrantion and FLFP

&lt;img src="figures//mig_flfp.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---


# Summarizing the FLFP results

One thousand dollars worth of export shock per person:

- 1.8 percentage point (pp), or 9.5 percent increase in RMG and adjacent occupations in the same year within this sample.

- 18 percent increase relative to full Bangladeshi sample.

--

- 0.6 percentage point (pp), or 3 percent increase in RMG and adjacent occupations in three year horizons.

--

- Slightly larger increases in broader low skilled, non-modern occupation.

  - Possibility of influence from allied industries

--

- Almost all of the increase is driven by new migrants into the area.

---

# Influence on autonomy

&lt;img src="figures//autonomy.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Influence on fertility preferences

&lt;img src="figures//preg_fertility.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Education and marraige

- Not presenting at this moment due to need for checking the data cleaning process.


---

# Conclusion

- In my estimates, at least .hi[11 million women] have been exposed to increased labor demand from export oriented garment manufacturing.

  - About 14 % of all Bangladeshi women.
  
--

- Results indicate that the garments industry provided opportunities for many of them to join manufacturing labor force. 

  - The result seems to be driven by people moving into garment producing areas, rather than existing women changing their occupation.
  
--

- No evidence in changes in autonomy or fertility behavior. Tentatively, no evidence on education  and marriage formation behavior either.

--

- Suggests that the changing conditions made the FLFP in formal settings possible, not the other way round.
