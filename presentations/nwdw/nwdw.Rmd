# Research question

To what extent does emergence of opportunities in the formal labor market influence:

  1. The quantity and pattern of female labor force participation,
  
  2. Marriage formation and reproductive behavior,
  
  3. Human capital accumulation decisions and
  
  4. Decision making autonomy of women
  

In a low autonomy, low human capital accumulation and moderate fertility environment.

# Four big changes: Women at school

# Tying them together

Large scale socio-economic changes in women's life in Bangladesh is concurrent with expansion of the RMG industry.

** To what extent is the RMG industry driving these changeS?**

# Prior research

## Heath and Mobarak (2015, JDE)

- Survey of 1395 households in 60 regions, 44 in garments commuting zones and 16 away, surveyed in 2009.

  - Average distance from capital is 1.8 KM for garment commuting zones, 6.8 KM for non-garments commuting zones.

- They find  that girls exposed to the garment sector
  - Decline in fertility by 29 pp
  - Increases FLFP by 15 pp
  - reduces gender education gap by 1.5 years.

# Methodology

## Overview of identification strategy

I am using Bartik style exposure measures

\begin{align}
Y_{i,r,t} &= \beta_z Z_{i,r,t} + \beta X_{r,t} + \delta_t + \text{Birth Year}_{i,r,t} + \epsilon_{i, r,t}
\end{align}

Where,

```{r out.width= "90%"}
include_graphics("figures//equation.png" )
```

- T = 3 in baseline specification, and

- Shares are instrumented with 5-year lags.

- Use spatio temporal variation in knit versus woven origination and export to generate export shocks that are potentially exogenous to the object of study.

## Bangladesh is dense

```{r out.width= "60%"}

```

- Dhaka district density is 23,234 / sq. KM. Portland's density is 1,888.

- Most garments workers commute <1.7 KM to work.

# Threats to identification

- Firm exists are not accounted for.

- Assumes orthogonality of knit and woven share to outcomes

- Coordinates are displaced.

# Results
---

# My contributions

- Provide alternative estimates of the labor demand shock that rely on exploiting variation in knit versus woven specialization of a RMG producing region, and variation in aggregate knit and woven exports over time. 

  - Controls for spatial development patterns better.
  
- Greater geographic and temporal coverage of data.

- Explore additional topics related to lives of women in Bangladesh.

# Overview of (preliminary) results

One thousand dollars worth of export shock per person:

- 17-18 percentage point (pp) increase in RMG and adjacent occupations
- 12 - 13 pp increase in non-traditional, low skilled occupations (which contains RMG adjacent occupations)
- A decline of 1 - 1.4 pp of FLFP in traditional sectors
- No change in high skilled occupations

- No changes in fertility

- *In future, I will extend analysis to explore impact on education of woman, marraige age, and changes in preferences for fertility, and woman's autonomy.*


---
- In my estimates, at least .hi[11 million women] have been exposed to export oriented RMG manufacturing.

  - About 14 % of all Bangladeshi women.

- .hi[True exposure is likely much higher.]

  - Does not take into account **supporting industries, exposure through peer effects, and movement of people**. 
  
- In other contexts, exposure to manufacturing jobs at the onset of development have been well documented to increase woman's education, autonomy and reduced fertility.
