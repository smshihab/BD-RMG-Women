# Expansion of the garments industry

# Could there be a connection?

## FLFP

- Textile and affiliated industry always employed relatively more women across different time and place.

--

  - Mid 1800s England (Burnette, n.d), USA (Field-Hendrey, 1998); developed and developing countries 1981-2008 (Kucera and Tejani, 2014).
  
--
  
  - Women engaged in more spinning and knitting for centuries *(Virginia Postrel, Textiles and the Fabric of Civilization)*
  
--

  - Did this "kick" off an overall FLFP transition in lines of Fogli and Veldkamp (2011)?

---
# Could there be a connection?

## Reproductive behavior

- Labor market opportunities changes cost and benefit of marriage, and the opportunity costs of having and raising children (see for Aaronson et al 2014; Greenwood et al 2017).

--

- But fertility transition was already on the way and may have aided women going to work rather than the other way round? 

--
## Education

- More schooling if returns to schoooling in RMG industry is adequate.

--

- Less if potential students ae better off working

--

.hi[All these are empirical questions!]

---
# Research questions

  1. To what extent did the emergence of the RMG industry contribute to the increase in FLFP in Bangladesh?
 
--

  2. What is the effect of the RMG industry on reproductive behavior of women (marriage and fertility)?
  
--

 3.  What is the effect of the RMG industry on human capital accumulation of Bangladeshi women.

---
# Why do we care?

1. Adds to the literature on manufacturing- and export-led growth. Especially relevant since:

--
  - Pre-mature industrialization (Rodrik, 2015)
  
  - Prevalence of women in RMG industry in Bangladesh seem to be declining, and is along the lines of what happens as technology
improves in a manufacturing sector (Tejani and Kucera, 2021).

--

2. Adds to the literature focusing on trade and lives of workers (Autor et al (2013), Li (2018) and Autor et al (2019)).

---
# Preview of the paper

## Methods

 - Estimates the long run impact of female labor demand shock on FLFP, fertility and human capital accumulation by:

  - Bartik shift-share method to identify labor demand shocks following a methodology similar to .hi[Autor et al (2013).]
  
  - Specifically, I exploit product specialization in the RMG industry along the knit versus woven line across sub-districts (Bangladesh administrative level-3) for identification.

# Knit versus Woven Specialization

```{r out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("figures//fac_dist.png")
```

--

- Producing woven is more energy and capital intensive, and commands about 10% higher per unit price (Sytsma, 2022).

--

- Woven factories are larger, and employs more women.

--

- About 90% labor tasks overlap.

---
# Location of RMG factories

```{r out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("figures//facs_loc.png")
```

--

- RMG factory location choice is mostly dependent on infrastructure quality (kagy, 2014).

# Identification strategy and data

# Overview of the identification strategy

  - Sub-districts with and without factories are likely to have different infrastructure quality, which maybe correlated with outcome variables. So, .hi[I restrict the analysis only to sub-districts that ever had a factory.]
  
--

  - Export exposure in sub-district $s$ in at time period $t$ depends on:
  
--
    - Intensity of knit versus woven specialization.
  
--

    - Variation in changes in demand for knit versus woven products products from Bangladesh.
  
---
# Regression Model

\begin{align*}
  \Delta Y_{s,t}&= \beta \space \Delta \text{Export Exposure}_{s,t} +  Z \beta_z + \delta_t + \epsilon_{s,t}, \text{ where,}
\end{align*}

- $\Delta Y_{s,t}$ is the decadal change in outcome variables in sub-district $s$ over decade ending at year $t$.

--

- $\text{Export Exposure}_{s,t}$ measures export exposure in sub-district over decade ending at year $t$.

--

- $\delta_t$ are census-year fixed-effects and $Z_{s, t}$ is a vector of sub-district specific controls including start of period electrification, urbanization, density, share of 15-64 year old in population, adult women's and men's education levels, measures of male labor force participation. Fertility regression also controls for starting period fertility, and schooling regression controls for male schooling.

# Export shock

Follows Autor et al (2019):

\begin{align*}
\Delta Export \space Exposure_{s,t} =& \alpha_{s,t-10}^{knit} * \Delta Knit \space Export_{t-10} + \\
&\alpha_{s,t-10}^{Woven} * \Delta Woven \space Export_{t-10} \\
\textit{and } \alpha_{s,t-10}^{knit} =& \frac{Workers_{s,knit,t-10}}{Workers_{BD-Knit,t-10}},\\
\alpha_{s,t-10}^{Woven} =& \frac{Workers_{s,woven,t-10}}{Workers_{BD-Woven,t-10}},
\end{align*}

--

 - Shares are instrumented with 1-year lags.
 
--

 - Estimates are not very sensitive to 1-5 year lag used.
 
---
# Identifying assumption

- .hi[Identifying assumption 1:] Extent of knit versus woven specialization in a sub-district is uncorrelated with outcomes.

--

- .hi[Identifying assumption 2:] FLFP responds similarly to woven and knit based shocks.

--

- .hi[Identifying assumption 3:]	Usual Bartik assumptions.

---
# Data Sources

- .hi[Outcome data] is obtained by aggregating individual-level data from the Bangladesh Census 1991 (10% sub-sample), 2001 (10% sub-sample) and 2011 (5% sub-sample).

--

- .hi[Factory data] are primarily from **Mapped in Bangladesh Project.**

  - Between 2017 and 2021, the project gathered information on all potentially existing factories from government and trade groups.
  
  - Processed the list and physically verified locations of 3805 factories in outside of export processing zones (EPZs).
  
  - I obtained EPZ factory data by scraping Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) website.

---
# Threats to identification

- Assumes orthogonality of knit and woven share to outcomes
    
  - Defensible since infrastructure, not labor related issues, seem to be the key factor in location choice of RMG factories (kagy, 2014).

--

- Factory data does not account for exits.

  - For example, my dataset identifies about 1914 firms in 2009. Astarloay (2015) identified 3548 firms.
  
  - Key concern is if exits are geographically correlated.

```

- Modest impact on FLFP that is stronger on industrial FLFP and among younger women. 

--

- No strong impact on men's labor force participation.

--

- At mean export exposure for a sub-district over two decades (203 million USD):

  - FLFP increases by 1.44 percentage point.
  

  
---
# FLFP


  - FLFP in industry for 15-39 year olds increase by 1.6 percentage point, and FLFP in industrial sectors increased by 2.3 percentage points.

--

- In my sample, FLFP in industrial sector increases from 1 percent of women in 1991 to 5 percent in 2011. So, exposure to RMG explains a good part of it.
  
--

- My estimates are smaller than Heath and Mubarak (2015).

--

  - Possibly since FLFP varies substantially by proximity to factories and I use a larger definition of labor markets.
  
    - Perhaps suggestive of limited diffusion?

# Education and Fertility

reg7 <- lm(fertility_39_diff ~ export_exposure1 + factor(year) + elec_lag + urban_lag + density_lag + m_educ_lag + f_educ_lag + lag(fertility_39) -1, data)

reg8 <- lm(school15_f_diff ~ export_exposure1 + factor(year) + urban_lag + elec_lag + density_lag +	m_educ_lag + 	f_educ_lag + school15_m_lag -1, data)
```


```{r}

include_graphics("figures//regs2.png")

```

--

- At average value of export exposure, fertility decreases by $-0.00812$ over two decades, contributing about 1.5% to the decline in factory exposed areas.

--

- Weak evidence of declining school enrollment.

---
# Conclusions

- Results indicate that the RMG industry provided opportunities for some of the women to join manufacturing labor force.

--

- However, most changes are likely driven by other factors.
--

- Some evidence of lower fertility among 15-39 year olds.
