abstract = {This paper studies the impact of export expansion due to the decline in tariffs faced by exporters on human capital accumulation across China. Following a theoretically consistent approach, I construct regional measures of high- and low-skill export demand shocks using the variation in initial industry composition across regions and differential skill intensities across industries. Using a sub-national data over the period 1990 to 2005, the empirical analysis shows that high-skill export shocks raise both high school and college enrollments, while low-skill export shocks depress both. These relationships appear to be attributable to the association between skill premium and skill demand embodied in export shocks. The amplified differences in skill abundance across regions reinforce the initial industry specialization patterns. These findings suggest a mutually reinforcing relationship between regional industry specialization and skill formation.}

For the first time, large numbers of young Bangladeshi women are being given an alternative to lives in which they move directly from childhood to adulthood through early marriage and childbearing. Employment creates a period of transition in contrast to the abrupt assumption of adult roles at very young ages that marriage and childbearing mandate. This longer transition creates a period of adolescence for young women working in the garment sector that is shown to have strong implications for the women's longterm reproductive health.},

abstract = {This paper provides a norm-based explanation for two features of the fertility transition that have been observed in many different settings: the slow response to external interventions and the wide variation in the response to the same intervention. Most societies have traditionally put norms into place to regulate fertility. When the economic environment changes, individuals gradually learn through their social interactions about the new reproductive equilibrium that will emerge in their community. This characterization of the fertility transition as a process of changing social norms is applied to rural Bangladesh, where norms are organized at the level of the religious group and interactions rarely cross religious boundaries. Consistent with the view that changing social norms are driving changes in reproductive behavior in these communities, we find that the individual's contraception decision responds strongly to changes in contraceptive prevalence in her own religious group within the village whereas cross-religion effects are entirely absent. Local changes in reproductive behavior occur independently across religious groups despite the fact that all individuals in the village have access to the same family planning inputs.}

 abstract = {BACKGROUND One of the fundamental arguments sustaining the classical demographic transition theory was that couples wanted to have a given number of surviving children, not a specific number of births. However, this cornerstone of transition theory came in for severe criticism in the wake of the results published in many studies linked to the Princeton European Fertility Project (PEFP). In recent years, studies using longitudinal microdata have made important contributions towards clarifying the relationship between mortality and fertility during the transition. OBJECTIVE We will show that aggregated data (from both the national and the provincial sphere) can lead to conclusions similar to those obtained at micro-level. METHODS Employing information from 25 developed countries, this article analyzes trends in net reproduction (rather than just the intensity of births) over a long period of time. We also quantify in detail the different influences of marital fertility, mortality, and nuptiality on historical developments in net total reproduction. RESULTS Our analysis reveals a great diversity in the reproductive patterns followed in different countries in the process of regulating the total number of births. We also detect the existence of a nonhomogeneous effect of mortality on net reproduction during the demographic transition. CONCLUSIONS There is little point in analyzing fertility trends if we leave out the mortality scenario that forms the background to these tendencies. CONTRIBUTION The results of this study using aggregated data (covering longer periods of time and larger geographical areas) are fully in line with those of recent projects using microdata from family reconstructions.},

The use of individual-level data allows us to analyze structural rural–urban differences, holding constant age and regional characteristics which are potentially confounding factors in regional- and country-level regressions.}

abstract = {One of the most dramatic economic transformations of the past century has been the entry of women into the labor force. While many theories explain why this change took place, we investigate the process of transition itself. We argue that local information transmission generates changes in participation that are geographically heterogeneous, locally correlated, and smooth in the aggregate, just like those observed in our data. In our model, women learn about the effects of maternal employment on children by observing nearby employed women. When few women participate in the labor force, data are scarce and participation rises slowly. As information accumulates in some regions, the effects of maternal employment become less uncertain and more women in that region participate. Learning accelerates, labor force participation rises faster, and regional participation rates diverge. Eventually, information diffuses throughout the economy, beliefs converge to the truth, participation flattens out, and regions become more similar again. To investigate the empirical relevance of our theory, we use a new county-level data set to compare our calibrated model to the time series and geographic patterns of participation.},

In India, outsourcing has created a new class of high-skill jobs which have increased overall returns to schooling. Existing evidence suggests education may broadly respond to this change. We use microdata to evaluate the impact of these jobs on local school enrollment in areas outside of major IT centers. We merge panel data on school enrollment from a comprehensive school-level administrative dataset with detailed data on Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) center location and founding dates. Using school ﬁxed effects, we ﬁnd that introducing a new ITES center causes a 5\% increase in the number of children enrolled in primary school; this effect is localized to within a few kilometers. We show the effect is driven by English-language schools, consistent with the claim that the impacts are due to changes in returns to schooling, and is not driven by changes in population or income resulting from the ITES center. Supplementary survey evidence suggests that the localization of the effects is driven by limited information diffusion.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that globalization increases inequality, by increasing skilled wage premiums in developing countries. This effect may be mitigated, however, if human capital responds to global opportunities. I study how the impact of globalization varies across Indian districts with different costs of learning English. Linguistic diversity in India compels individuals to learn English or Hindi. Some districts have lower relative costs of learning English due to linguistic predispositions. I demonstrate that these districts benefited more from globalization: They experienced greater growth in information technology and school enrollment. Consistent with this response, they experienced smaller increases in skilled wage premiums.},

I use variation in the timing of factory openings across commuting zones to show that school drop-out increased with local expansions in export-manufacturing industries. The magnitudes I find suggest that for every 25 jobs created, one student dropped out of school at grade 9 rather than continuing through to grade 12. These effects are driven by less-skilled export-manufacturing jobs which raised the opportunity cost of schooling for students at the margin.},

It articulates the RMG workers’ existing vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic based on currently available evidence and personal conversations/communications with RMG workers. COVID-19 has already impacted RMG workers’ health (both physical and mental health status) and wellbeing, and resulted in loss of employment. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on the garment workers, especially related to their health issues, financial hardship and inability to pay for essentials such as food, and future employment opportunities. The stakeholders (such as the international retailers/brands, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Government of Bangladesh) responsible for the global supply chain RMG factories should reconsider the health and overall wellbeing needs of the RMG workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {This article examines gendered employment implications of structural transformation and technological upgrading in manufacturing. It focuses on 14 countries that relied heavily on exports of labour-intensive and assembly industries that have long provided strategic entry points onto global markets. The study uses accounting decomposition methods to identify the drivers of changes in female shares of manufacturing employment as well as econometric analysis to assess the gendered impacts of technological upgrading. This study is the first to apply either of these methods at a detailed industry level as well as the first to estimate long-run relationships between women's representation in manufacturing employment and technological upgrading. The main findings are that within-industry effects on female shares of employment are generally more important than employment reallocation effects and that there is more often a negative than positive relationship between technological upgrading and female shares of employment at the country and industry levels. These negative effects of technological upgrading are found in four of the five strategic export-oriented industries--food, beverages and tobacco products; textiles; apparel, leather products and footwear; and motor vehicles. The article discusses the policy implications of these findings and of the defeminization of manufacturing employment more generally.},

We show that the typical use of a Bartik instrument assumes a pooled exposure research design, where the shares measure differential exposure to common shocks, and identification is based on exogeneity of the shares. Next, we show how the Bartik instrument weights each of the exposure designs. Finally, we discuss how to assess the plausibility of the research design. We illustrate our results through two applications: estimating the elasticity of labor supply, and estimating the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives.

	abstract = {Many studies use shift-share (or “Bartik”) instruments, which average a set of shocks with exposure share weights. We provide a new econometric framework for shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions in which identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks, while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency. We discuss and illustrate several practical insights of this framework in the setting of Autor et al. (2013), estimating the effect of Chinese import competition on manufacturing employment across U.S. commuting zones.},

Evidence shows that reforms and integration into global production chains have rapidly expanded China's exports but these have also driven the relocation abroad of Chinese clothing firms. Global integration has motivated clothing firms to upgrade through learning, adoption and innovation. Hence, despite improvements in technological capabilities the share of clothing value-added in manufacturing has gradually declined. Also, China has increasingly faced industrial structural change from clothing to the capital goods, real estate and high-tech sectors.},
